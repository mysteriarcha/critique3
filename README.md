This is the repository for the manuscript: 
"Critique of Critical Criticisms: a review of the uses and abuses of ecological and economic theories as well as their alternatives".
We discuss recent and classic philosophical debates on the pitfalls of ecology and economics. Some of them we find lacking in thoroughness and/or misaimed, barring the possibility for more powerful and ambitious reflections.

We argue for:

1. Pluralism in research programs
2. Historical understanding of the status of these disciplines
3. Thorough consciousness of their social implications

With it we aim to enlarge both scientific and sociological imagination for these distressing times
